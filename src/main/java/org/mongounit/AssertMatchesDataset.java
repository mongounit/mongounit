 * It can be used on a class, on a method, or in combination of the two, which would have a
 * cumulative effect, i.e., the data pointed to by the method annotation would be added to the data
 * pointed to by the class annotation.
 *
 * There is also an option to trigger assertion with no additional dataset by setting this
 * annotation's 'additionalDataset' to 'false'. In such a case, previously set assertion datasets
 * (if any at all) are used. This can be used to verify that nothing exists in the database or if
 * the dataset is coming from {@link SeedWithDataset} annotation with the 'reuseForAssertion' set to
 * 'true'.
 *
 * If neither the target test method nor its containing target test class is annotated with this
 * annotation, no automatic assertion takes place.
